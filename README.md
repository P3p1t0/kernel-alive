# kernel-alive

Collection of scripts that back up modules of currently used kernel after a kernel update to prevent some issues that happen after a kernel update. Modules backed up this way can still be used by current kernel. Therefore, it helps the operating system to stay fully functional after a kernel update.

New version of the kernel will be used at next boot.
